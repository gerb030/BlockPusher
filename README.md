TODO
----
- Tile removal timing not optimal
- detection of duplicate hits in checkturn seems to be broken 
- tile size etc needs to be moved to Config file.
- Game.checkTurn: only deals with diagonals sloping topleft to bottomright.
- deal with row removal
- deal with col removal
- compile & obfuscate js
